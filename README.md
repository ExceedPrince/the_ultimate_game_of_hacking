# the_ultimate_game_of_hacking

This is a team project from the CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

We were free to choose what to do, the main point was to create game.
This was my team's biggest project and what can I say? It's really fun!
Compared to this was first game for most of us and was made by pure CSS and Javascripst, it's not bad!
This is still an unfinished project, we still update it with some new features from time to time.

I had some Javascript work in this project, but we agreed on that we had a very short time limit to create this game, so everybody should do that part what he's the best at. So that's why the 90% of the design was my work.

Everyone is free to download and play it, have fun!
